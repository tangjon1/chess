# Microservice

Start the microservice, and it will constantly be checking the chess_move.txt file for any tuples that refer to a chess move. It will then delete the tuple, and replace it with the plain english version of the move (a8, d4, etc.).

Only pass information you want to be translated to the txt file. It will delete anything currently in the file.
